                    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                    <p>My name is Bisrat Dereje, and I hail from Chiro City in West Hararge. Born in 1995 EC, I grew up in a vibrant and supportive family that has played a significant role in shaping who I am today.
                      Growing up in Chiro, I was surrounded by a nurturing environment, with my family placing a strong emphasis on education and personal development. I have one brother and two sisters, and together, we were encouraged to pursue our passions and strive for success.
                      In Hararge, our community is closely-knit, and I was fortunate to have many friends who made my childhood life interesting and joyful. Together, we created countless memories, engaging in various activities and adventures that enriched our experiences.
                      My parents, both dedicated teachers, instilled in us the values of knowledge, hard work, and compassion for others. Their commitment to education has inspired me to seek continuous growth and to value learning as a lifelong journey.</p>

                    <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
                    <p>I completed my high school education at Chercher Secondary and Preparatory School from 2010 to 2014 EC. Thanks to my high marks on the university entrance exam, I received the opportunity to attend Addis Ababa University.
                       I am currently a third-year student at the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology (AAIT), specializing in Software Engineering within the School of Information Technology Engineering. I am eager to explore opportunities in this field, where I can apply my skills and knowledge.
                       As a hard worker with strong teamwork and communication abilities, I am committed to contributing to a dynamic tech team. I am dedicated to further developing my technical skills while effectively collaborating on projects and embracing new learning opportunities.</p>
